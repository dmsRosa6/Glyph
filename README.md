## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**  
  Build UIs using reusable components such as `Box`, `Window`, and other primitives.

- **Composite Components**  
  Components can contain other components, enabling hierarchical layouts and structured UI trees.

- **Custom Rendering Engine**  
  Internal rendering pipeline that manages drawing order, composition, and screen buffering.

- **Dual Rendering Modes**
  - **Immediate Mode** – Render on demand when explicitly triggered.
  - **Continuous Mode** – Automatic re-rendering loop for dynamic interfaces with fps.

- **Viewport & Clipping Support**  
  Built-in clipping system that ensures components render only within their visible boundaries.

- **Canvas Abstraction**  
  Low-level drawing surface responsible for rune placement, layering, and buffer management.

- **Layout Control**
  - Absolute positioning
  - Nested positioning via parent offsets
  - Boundary-aware rendering

- **Window System**
  - Composable windows
  - Structured content areas
  - Encapsulated rendering logic

- **Minimal & Dependency-Light**  
  Focused on understanding core TUI mechanics without heavy abstractions.

- **Built for Learning**
